Hello, my name is hib and this is a modification of Emp`s 1.2.3RC2.
This project has taken me almost a year or so to test skills out and make the pokemod not too overpowered.
I altered the cooldowns and a couple other things.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions regarding installation and what not.
Add me via steam @ Lobopack23.

*Regarding my season 3, that will start being given out by donations, since i've taken my time to work on that as well*
I'm not really a coder, but a modifier of code. I know a few things but im still learning.
Anyways have fun and hope you like my modifications. (Note: Please do not claim this modification as your own, since i have worked hard and given credits to emp` for his original mod)
